# Introduction
# Design-Documentation
## User-Requirments

- A profile of the company itself
- job specifications and required qualifications
- an on-line application form
- links to web development courses

These were the requirements that were given to me from the organisation for the creation of the website. Based on these requirements my website will have four pages. 

The first page will be the home page that will have an image of the company's office building, then introduction to the company as well as contact information and privacy policy for the website. 

The second page will be an about us page that will start with how the company was founded and information about all of the employees and the pictures for the employees as well.

The third page will be an application page that will have posts about the currently vacant jobs and an application form they can fill out to apply for these positions. 

 The final page will be the courses page where there will be information on local courses as well as online options with links to take you to their pages.

A range of green, blue, white and black.

the reason for this is that it matches the colours of the companys logo  as well as allowing for for a simple design. that lokks quite sharp.

# Code-Deveolpment

Once I finished the plan and stared to create a website the first thing i did was to create each page and have a menu where you can access the page at the top by just clicking the button.

After that I decided to add the company logo to the page as it made the page stand out better and look better overall.

Then finally i deced to add borders to all of the images as it made them appear less rigid anf make the website flow better overall.

## Usability-Testing

The first test for usabuty is to see all of the different search engins that this website would run on
it has work on the following:
- google
- google chrome
- internet edplore
- opera GX
- Bing

The next part I tests is how the website change if it is resized.
the results where good as a off the images and text would move and adjust so id did not really afect how the website would appear.

the final test was to see how the sebsite appeared on different devices.
the deveices that i tested the webiste on were. Pc, laptot. phone and tablet.
On all of these platforms the website ran fine and did not face any issue s in making sure that it appeared similar on all dvevices.

# Evaluation 
## Final-Evaluation
I believe that my website met the clients requirements as first of all it has a profile of the company on the about us page as well as a description of all the employees. Secondly, I have both of the job descriptions and these both contain the specification and required qualifications needed for the job. Also below these job descriptions is a full application form that people can fill out to contact the company for a potential interview.  Furthermore, there are descriptions and links to many courses that they can complete to get the required qualifications. Finally  the overall website flows well and is easy to navigate and understand what is going on. 

therfore I believe that this website does infact meet the clinets requirments.

## Potential-Future-Improvements 
There are a few things that could be done to make the website even better. First of all the website could have more colour as it is a lot of white so using more colour ihelp slit it up and look better. Secondly, I would add more images as there are not many while there is a lot of writing and the image would break it up and look better. 

Therefore the website works well and has all of the required features . the website could be more visually appealing to be even better

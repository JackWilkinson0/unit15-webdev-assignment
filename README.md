# Introduction
# Design-Documentation
## User-Requirments

- A profile of the company itself
- job specifications and required qualifications
- an on-line application form
- links to web development courses

These were the requirements that were given to me from the organisation for the creation of the website. Based on these requirements my website will have four pages. 

The first page will be the home page that will have an image of the company's office building, then introduction to the company as well as contact information and privacy policy for the website. 

The second page will be an about us page that will start with how the company was founded and information about all of the employees and the pictures for the employees as well.

The third page will be an application page that will have posts about the currently vacant jobs and an application form they can fill out to apply for these positions. 

 The final page will be the courses page where there will be information on local courses as well as online options with links to take you to their pages.

A range of green, blue, white and black.

the reason for this is that it matches the colours of the companys logo  as well as allowing for for a simple design. that lokks quite sharp.

# Code-Deveolpment

After that I decided to add the company logo to the page as it made the page stand out better and look better overall.

Then finally i deced to add borders to all of the images as it made them appear less rigid anf make the website flow better overall.
